# rocker

A tool to run docker images with customized local support injected for things like nvidia support. And user id specific files for cleaner mounting file permissions.

## Know extensions

Rocker supports extensions via entry points there are some built in but you can add your own. Here's a list of public repositories with extensions.

- Off-your-rocker: https://github.com/sloretz/off-your-rocker

# Prerequisites

This should work on most systems using with a recent docker version available.

Docker installation instructions: https://docs.docker.com/install/

## NVIDIA settings

For the NVIDIA option this has been tested on the following systems using nvidia docker2:

| Ubuntu distribution | Linux Kernel | Nvidia drivers                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 16.04               | 4.15         | nvidia-384 (works) <br> nvidia-340 (doesn't work) |
| 18.04               |              | nvidia-390 (works)                                |
| 20.04               | 5.4.0        | nvidia-driver-460 (works)                         |
| 22.04               | 5.13.0        | nvidia-driver-470 (works)                         |

Install nvidia-docker 2: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker

### Additional Configuration for rootless mode
For executing Docker as a non-root user, separate installation instructions are provided here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/

After installing Rootless Docker, the nvidia-docker2 package can be installed as usual from the website above.
Currently, [cgroups are not supported in rootless mode](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/38729) so we need to change `no-cgroups` in */etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml*

```shell
[nvidia-container-cli]
no-cgroups = true
```

Note, that changing this setting will lead to a `Failed to initialize NVML: Unknown Error` if Docker is executed as root (noted [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime/issues/85)).

## Intel integrated graphics support

For intel integrated graphics support you will need to mount through a specific device

```
--devices /dev/dri/card0
```


# Installation

## Debians (Recommended)
Debian packages are available from the ROS repositories. You can set them up in step one [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) then come back.

Then you can `sudo apt-get install python3-rocker`

## PIP

If you're not on a Ubuntu or Debian platform.

Rocker is available via pip you can install it via pip using

`pip install rocker`

## Archlinux ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/))

Using any AUR helper, for example, with `paru`

```bash
paru -S python-rocker
```

or 

```bash
paru -S python-rocker-git
```

## Development
To set things up in a virtual environment for isolation is a good way. If you don't already have it install python3's venv module.

    sudo apt-get install python3-venv

Create a venv

    mkdir -p ~/rocker_venv
    python3 -m venv ~/rocker_venv

Install rocker

    cd ~/rocker_venv
    . ~/rocker_venv/bin/activate
    pip install git+https://github.com/osrf/rocker.git

For any new terminal re activate the venv before trying to use it.

    . ~/rocker_venv/bin/activate

### Testing

To run tests install nose and coverage in the venv

    . ~/rocker_venv/bin/activate
    pip install nose
    pip install coverage

Then you can run nosetests.

    nosetests-3.4 --with-coverage --cover-package rocker

Notes:

- Make sure to use the python3 instance of nosetest from inside the environment.
- The tests include an nvidia test which assumes you're using a machine with an nvidia gpu.


# Example usage


## Fly a drone

Example usage with an iris

    rocker --nvidia --x11 --user --home --pull --pulse tfoote/drone_demo

After the ekf converges, 

You can send a takeoff command and then click to command the vehicle to fly to a point on the map.


## Fly a plane

Example usage with a plane 

    rocker --nvidia --x11 --user --home --pull --pulse tfoote/drone_demo roslaunch sitl_launcher plane_demo.launch world_name:=worlds/plane.world gui:=false

In QGroundControl go ahead and make a mission, upload it, and then start the mission.

## ROS 2 rviz

    rocker --nvidia --x11 osrf/ros:crystal-desktop rviz2


## Generic gazebo

On Xenial

    rocker --nvidia --x11 osrf/ros:kinetic-desktop-full gazebo

On Bionic

    rocker --nvidia --x11 osrf/ros:melodic-desktop-full gazebo

## Volume mount

### For arguments with one element not colon separated

`--volume` adds paths as docker volumes.

**The last path must be terminated with two dashes `--`**.

    rocker --volume ~/.vimrc ~/.bashrc -- ubuntu:18.04

The above example of the volume option will be expanded via absolute paths for `docker run` as follows:

    --volume /home/<USERNAME>/.vimrc:/home/<USERNAME>/.vimrc --volume /home/<USERNAME>/.bashrc:/home/<USERNAME>/.bashrc  

### For arguments with colon separation

It will process the same as `docker`'s `--volume` option, `rocker --volume` takes 3 fields.
- 1st field: the path to the file or directory on the host machine.
- 2nd field: (optional) the path where the file or directory is mounted in the container.
   - If only the 1st field is supplied, same value as the 1st field will be populated as the 2nd field.
- 3rd field: (optional) bind propagation as `ro`, `z`, and `Z`. See [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) for further detail.
